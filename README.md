# Time-Series-Analysis
This is a project written up as an article that I did in 2021 as a part of the CS577 Data Science graduate class at the San Diego State University.

Research Topic: Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Autoregression Moving Average (VARMAX) Models in Time Series Analysis of the Relation Between the Number of Scientific Articles Published on PubMed for a Top 2 Medical Conditions in the US and the Amount of Funding Allocated to Study those Conditions by the National Institute of Health.

Abstract— This paper looks at the relationship between the number of scientific articles published on PubMed for a top 2 medical conditions in the US and the amount of funding allocated to study those conditions by the NIH.  This topic is worth researching because it is important to know if NIH funding decisions have an impact on the research being done to address the medical diseases and conditions affecting US  population the most. Datasets used in this study were created by querying PubMed advanced search tool [1],[2] with combination of keywords that best represent top 2 medical conditions (cardiovascular diseases and cancers) as rated by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 [3],[4].  The top 2 conditions were chosen based on the burden of disease which is  measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [5]. Additionally, a historical NIH research funding information [6] dataset was used for this study. 
This study evaluated two autoregression models, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model and Vector Autoregression Moving Average (VARMA) Model. VAR model was determined to be a better model for the time series forecasting in this study than VARMA model.
Keywords—VAR, VARMA, time series, NIH, burden of disease, PubMed
